    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the binary assignment, we had to learn the basic fundamentals of binary and how to write, read, and add binary. We started with a simple lesson of how binary works and were then given a worksheet to work on. On the worksheet we had to convert numbers to binary, binary to numbers, and decode a message written in binary.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        The assignment was interesting but a bit boring because it was just counting basically. It was interesting to see the Ascii table since I haven't seen it yet.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I all ready new the basics of binary and how you could convert numbers to letters and vice versa, but I haven't seen the Ascii table until this point and it was cool to see how things translated.
