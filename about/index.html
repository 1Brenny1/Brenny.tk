    <h3>What do I do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        Currently I have been focusing on making Minecraft servers and making Roblox games. I also sometimes like to make Unity games or mess around on scratch. When I'm bored I like to mess around in Python and make small applications using PyGame. Currently I have been making a game engine in my free time, which I am calling PyEngine.

        <summary>How did you start programming?</summary>
        <p>I started programming when I was around 10 years old, I started off by following a Python tutorial on how to make Snake using the Turtle library. I never ended up getting the game working but it did spark my interest in programming. A year later I downloaded Roblox Studios and started watching tutorials on how to make stuff again. I never got far but like before it made me want to learn more. A few months later I learned about Unity and using C# to make good proffesional games. I watched a few tutorials and managed to learn a lot and got really fluent at coding without the need for googling stuff, and ever since then I have been finding new languages to try and learn to solve different tasks.</p>
